# Dev environment

## Vite

Module bundler dor aplications. (Like webpack, creates the dist folder.)

Compacts our project into as few files as posible.

* Performant
* Third party libraries (from ts to sass)
* Extendable


## sass

Extends css for contidions, loops, classes

npm install sass

replace the .css for .scss

support css features

## ESLint

We should always be consistent and error free JavaScript is a great language, but it does not enforce  strict rules for formatting our code.

You can set rules to be consistent, like the quotes or the ; at the en of lines etc.

You will have to edit or create the vite.config.js if you are working with vite.

## webpack

it is the most used Module Bundler.

you will see a file webpack.config.js.

webpack only supports Js, no css or sass you will must install pluggins for them.
